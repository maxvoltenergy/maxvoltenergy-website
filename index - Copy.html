            <h3>A guava forest in Bundelkhand</h3>
			<p>We are a small educated group of people who still like to live with nature and are living a life of comfort from the hustle and bustle of the city.</p>
            <p class="fst-italic">
              This journey started 80 years ago from now, When we came from Kaushambi district and settled our house on the barren lands here. And in the beginning, we planted 2 hectare of guava trees and after that 1 hectare of mango trees were planted then the process started.
            </p>
			<p class="fst-italic"> We have planted trees like Lemon, Jackfruit, Mango, Amla, Jamun, Guava, Sharifa and Cherry etc.</p>
			
            <p>Our house, or rather it is in the middle of our guava orchards and there is no house anywhere from two to three kilometers around, there are two water well in the garden and there is a big pond. Small rivers come from two sides and join each other. Due to which it has become even more beautiful.
