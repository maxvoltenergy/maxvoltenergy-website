      <p> The modern technological world is evolving rapidly,
        as the new inventions have been introduced, the main
        focus lies upon lessening the pollution in the environment.
        The developing world is continually trying to ease up human
        efforts without creating any damage to the surrounding nature.</p>


       <p> The most astonishing invention of all is the vehicles that run on batteries,
         electric vehicles. As petrol, as well as the diesel prices,
         are blowing off through the roof, electric vehicles can be an excellent solution.</p>

        <p>The electric vehicles are those vehicles that posses rechargeable electric batteries.
          The batteries in the vehicle can be charged on by electricity,
          and when the batteries get fully charged, this power is then supplied to the engine,
          the energy form the cells help that vehicle run.</p>

        <p>The electric vehicles or EV are incredibly beneficial in environmental
          aspects the other benefits are,</p>
      <p>

        Reduces the cost of the fuel required
        Gain independence in terms of energy supply
        Contributes to global warming
        Reduces external exhaust emission resting in lesser smog
        Lowers the risk of any significant explosion or sudden fire
        As exhaust emission is low, the internal emission reduces too giving the engine a more extended life
      </p>

      <p>
        The engine of electric vehicles remains very clean from inside,
        as there are no petrol or diesel impurities that cause the engine to clog.
      </p>

      <p>

        The electric vehicles include vehicles like bikes, cycles, cars, and rickshaws.</p>

       <p> Join the hands with the new revolution, which protects the pockets as well a the environment.
        Proudly ride the electric vehicle and help the world from global warming.
      </p>
